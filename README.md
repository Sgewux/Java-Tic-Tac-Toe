# Java CLI Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a shell tic-tac-toe-game made in Java.
In this game you will play against the computer wich won't be easy because the program uses the current board state to decide how to play to aproach the two main pourposes (defeat you and don't let you win).

#### Note
This is one of my firts Java programs, if you have any feedback please tell me.
